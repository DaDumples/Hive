# Hive

The rules of Hive:
https://www.ultraboardgames.com/hive/game-rules.php

Q, A, S, B , G will allow for placement of a Queen, Ant, Spider, Beetle, and Grasshopper respectively. M allows you to select a piece and then a location to move to. If you have any complaints with the games cutting edge artistic decisions please send me a kindly worded email.

To run:

From Playable_Baseline, current version is as it was when I passed out one day during finals week.

python Hive.py

This file includes some visualization scripts that may or may not still work. They were very useful at some point!

The end goal for this project is to implement a monte carlo tree search and neural network to learn how to play Hive. I am trying to emulate the work of Alpha Zero, which played against itself and became a chess demon.
